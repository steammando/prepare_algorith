```Given two strings s and t, determine if they are isomorphic.

Two strings s and t are isomorphic if the characters in s can be replaced to get t.

All occurrences of a character must be replaced with another character while preserving the order of characters. 
No two characters may map to the same character, but a character may map to itself.
```
```
Example 1:

Input: s = "egg", t = "add"
Output: true
```

- Problem Summary
  - we are given two strings and determine if they are isomorphic.

- Approach
  - I made two maps to keep the pairs for string map from string s to t and string t to s.
  - Loop over s and check all the pairs in map1 maps correctly to t.
  - Same to string t
  - If there is mismatch, return False.




- My Solution
``` python
class Solution:
    def isIsomorphic(self, s: str, t: str) -> bool:    
        map1 = {}
        map2 = {}
        
        for i in range(len(s)):
            S = s[i]
            T = t[i]
            if S in map1:
                if T != map1[S]:
                    return False
            else:
                if T in map2:
                    return False
                else:
                    map1[S] = T
                    map2[T] = ""
                    
        return True
```
