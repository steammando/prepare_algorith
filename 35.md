35. Search Insert Position

```
Given a sorted array of distinct integers and a target value, return the index if the target is found. If not, return the index where it would be if it were inserted in order.

You must write an algorithm with O(log n) runtime complexity.
```
 
```
Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,3,5,6], target = 5
Output: 2
```

- Approach
  - Simple binary search problem
  - The search will be half the availiable array
  
  
- My Solution
```python
class Solution:
    def searchInsert(self, nums: List[int], target: int) -> int:
        left = 0
        right = len(nums) - 1
        
        while left <= right:
            mid = (left + right) // 2
            
            if nums[mid] < target:
                left = mid + 1
                
            elif nums[mid] > target:
                right = mid - 1

            else:
                return mid
            
        return left
   ```
   
   - Time Complexity : O(log n)
