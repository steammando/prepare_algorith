263. Ugly Number

```
An ugly number is a positive integer whose prime factors are limited to 2, 3, and 5.

Given an integer n, return true if n is an ugly number.
```

```
Example 1:

Input: n = 6
Output: true
Explanation: 6 = 2 Ã— 3
```


- Approach
  - keep divide [2,3,5] and when remainder is 0 then True, else False

- My Solution
```python
class Solution:
    def isUgly(self, n: int) -> bool:
        if n <= 0:
            return False
        
        for i in [2,3,5]:
            while n % i is 0:
                n = n // i
        return n is 1
```
